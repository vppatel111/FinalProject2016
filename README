-Also see attached Figure 1 for the orientation of joystick and LCD screen

To run the project:
Requirements: -Have LCD Screen and Joystick set up in given configuration.
-Have title.lcd downloaded onto the mini-SD card for the LCD screen.
-Have EEPROM initialized (highscoreTable), see below for further instructions.

- From command terminal: 1. Navigate to the FinalProject directory using "cd".
2. Then initialize the EEPROM by navigating to the initializeHighscore folder
using "cd" and typing "make upload", to initialize a dummy highscore table.
3. Now we can run the game by navigating back to the FinalProject folder and
typing "make upload".

Note: To reinitialize the highscore board, navigate back to the initializeHighscore
folder and simply "make upload" again to reset the values.

Additional Features (added after demo):
-When a player gets a highscore they are able to enter their initials.
-Highscore table, that stores up to 12 highscores and a player's initials
in the EEPROM and displays the table when the option is selected at a game over.
