Project Title: Breaker

Team Members: Vishal Patel, Max Scales

Description: Breaker was a popular atari game released in April 1976.
In breaker the top layer of the screen is lined with multi-colour bricks
and the bottom layer has a controllable paddle the entire screen is surrounded
by walls, a small ball bounces from the paddle to the bricks, when the ball
hits the paddle it bounces up towards the bricks, when the ball hits a brick
the brick disappears and it bounces back down, the ball can also bounce off
of walls. The objective of the game is to clear all the bricks without having
the ball fall off the screen, that is, the player fails to bounce back up the
ball and it goes past the paddle.
